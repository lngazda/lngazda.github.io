      <description>Statisticians swear by R and CS majors go full die-hard for Python, but really the debate on which is the better programming language comes down to personal preference. In fact you don’t even have to chose. With the Reticulate package you can work in R and create interactive Python code chunk, or if you prefer the Python layout you can access the Jupyter Notebook for R access.
I would love to look further into Python packages (I’ve just explored a little of Pandas for data frame manipulation) but just to show I’ll give a quick simple demo.</description>

      <description>Data Wrangling and Exploration Lauren Gazda  eID: lng673  Introduction to the Data I used to be a very athletic person. I swam competitively when I was younger and was also on the track team in high school. When I went on to college I was disappointed when I was only able to workout a couple times a week. Then just as I had signed up for a marathon in attempt to reverse my idleness and try something new, quarantine hit.</description>

      <description>Lauren Gazda  eID: lng673  Introduction to the Data Since COVID delayed my first marathon, I chose to analyze the daily training for a marathon runner which I found in the Stat2Data package. The modified Marathon dataset I imported contains 307 observations which document a runner’s daily run from 2005-2006 with no ShoeBrand N/A entries. I will be looking at the numeric variables Miles: Miles for training run, TimeMin: Training time (in minutes), and the PaceMin: Running pace (in minutes per mile).</description>
